Safe Tracker

We created this app during our Hackathon, and won first place with it!

This app was created for parents that want to track their children to make sure they are safe. The parent can define specific locations like home, school, friend's house, and whatever they want. Once their children will be in one of the defined locations, the parent will get notified.

In addition, the child can press if needed the SOS button, which alerts the parent with a message that allows to as well call the police.

This app was made with the following technologies:
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, JWT, Bcrypt
